All subjects will have completed initial, standard- therapy with surgical debulking, followed by radiation and temozolomide (TMZ) and will, therefore, be considered treatment failures. Patients with truly unmethylated GBM do not require prior treatment with temozolomide (TMZ).

Patients may retain whatever medications they are receiving for other conditions (e.g., hypertension, seizures), except patients requiring insulin or sulfonylurea therapy (see below). The probability of adverse drug-drug interactions is extremely low, for the following reasons. First, DCA is the only pharmaceutical in clinical use that is metabolized by GSTZ1. Second, DCA is not known to be metabolized by any other drug metabolizing enzyme system, thus precluding competition with other agents for biotransformation. Third, the results of both open label and randomized controlled trials of orally or parenterally administered DCA in the treatment of children and/or adults have never shown evidence of adverse drug-drug interactions (34). Thus, from decades of clinical investigations of use of DCA in various acutely or chronically ill populations, there is nothing to suggest adverse drug-drug interactions should be anticipated in this trial.

Diagnosis: Patients with newly diagnosed HGG, including DIPG are eligible. Diagnosis must have histologic confirmation from biopsy or resection. The diagnosis of HGG must have been confirmed by pathology review at the local site. For the diagnosis of DIPG, patients must have a tumor with pontine epicenter and diffuse involvement of at least 2/3 of the pons, with histopathology consistent with diffuse WHO grade 2-4 glioma (eg, diffuse astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma, H3K27-altered diffuse midline glioma). For all other tumors, histologic grade must be WHO grade 3-4. 3. Disease Status: There are no disease status requirements for enrollment. Measurable disease is not required. Patients without measurable disease are eligible. Patients with metastatic/disseminated or multifocal disease or gliomatosis cerebri are eligible. Patients with a primary spinal tumor are eligible. Patients with secondary, radiation related HGG are eligible. 4. Prior Therapy for HGG: Surgery, radiation, and/or dexamethasone are permissible. Temozolomide concurrent with radiation is permissible. Prior administration of avastin/bevacizumab is allowed (individual treatment arms have different washout period requirements, check individual arm eligibility). No other prior anticancer therapy for HGG will be allowed. Participants screening for assignment to TarGeT-L may not have received radiation. Timing from surgery to start of RT: For patients who have started RT, radiation must have started \\<42 days from definitive surgery or biopsy, however it is strongly recommended patients start RT within 31 days from definitive surgery (if patient had two surgeries, radiation must have started within 31 days from second surgery). 5.

It is highly recommended that results be uploaded within 7 days of enrollment (if results are available at time of enrollment) or within 7 days of results becoming available (if pending at time of enrollment) to allow adequate time for central review. 6. Informed Consent: All patients and/or their parents or legally authorized representatives must sign a written informed consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional guidelines. 7. Enrollment timeline: Patients are eligible to enroll on the TarGeT-SCR anytime between diagnosis and the following specific timepoints post completion of RT (if relevant) Patients screening through OPTION #1 are eligible to enroll anytime between diagnosis and 10 days post RT (if completing RT). Patients screening through OPTIONS #2 or #3 are eligible to enroll anytime between diagnosis and 21 days post RT (if completing RT). Participants screening for TarGeT-L (lorlatinib) are eligible to enroll on TarGeT-SCR anytime between diagnosis and 31 days post definitive surgery (to allow time for molecular review). However, it is important to note the following: For treatment protocols that include targeted therapy administered concurrently with RT, patients must start treatment within 10 calendar days of starting RT.

Patients must be 8 weeks from radiotherapy to minimize the potential for MRI changes related to radiation necrosis that might be misdiagnosed as progression of disease, or 4 weeks if a new lesion, relative to the pre-radiation MRI, develops that is outside the primary radiation field (beyond 80% isodose line). However, if a biopsy is undertaken prior to these times and this biopsy documents histological evidence for recurrent disease, then patients will be eligible regardless of the time after radiation. 16. Patients must be willing to forego other cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic drug or radiation therapy against the tumor while enrolled in the study. 17.
