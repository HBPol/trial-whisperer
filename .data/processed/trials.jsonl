{"text": "1. Pregnancy or Breast-Feeding: Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study due to unknown potential risks of fetal and teratogenic adverse events as seen in animal studies. Pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal. Patients of childbearing or child fathering potential must agree to use one highly effective method of contraception while being treated on this study and for 3 months after completing therapy. A woman is considered of childbearing potential if she is fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy. Male participants should refrain from sperm donation throughout the duration of treatment and for 3 months after completion of therapy. A highly effective contraception method is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (\\<1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. The following are considered highly effective contraception methods: Combined estrogen and progesterone containing hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation. Progesterone-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation. Intra Uterine Device (IUD). Intra uterine hormone releasing system. Bilateral tubal occlusion. Vasectomized partner. Sexual abstinence (avoiding heterosexual intercourse).

Participants must be at least 18 years old on day of signing informed consent. Participants must have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) \u2265 60 Participants must be able to swallow capsules/tablets Participants with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy of the trial are eligible. Nature of illness and treatment history Participants must undergo central pathology review to histologically confirm the diagnosis of glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype; glioblastoma variants; or astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, WHO grade 4 (1 unstained slide or 1 H\\&E slide must be submitted to and reviewed by a pathologist at the DFCI Coordinating Center prior to enrollment of the participant for central pathology review). To be eligible for the study all participants (Cohort 1 and 2) are required to provide genomic profiling data from assays performed in a CLIA-certified lab. A sequencing-based assay is required and must include reporting of the RB1 gene in explicit terms within the report. Only sequencing assays that include coverage of all exons of the RB1 gene are able to be utilized (most commonly called a targeted exome assay; e.g. Oncopanel, Impact, FoundationOne). In addition, patients must provide a report of copy assessment which reports status of RB1. The reporting may be from a copy array (ideally Oncoscan SNP array or Agilent array CGH) or can also be from sequencing assay if copy status is explicitly provided with quantitative information regarding the status of relevant genes. Specifically, the reporting should provide the following information with respect to relevant biomarkers required for enrollment to the study as listed below. Results from genomic profiling must be sent to the DFCI Coordinating Center prior to enrollment of the participant for central pathology review. Inactivation of CDKN2A/B or C in the tumor by homozygous deletion (evidence for more than single copy loss for any of the genes defined as array CGH/SNP log2 ratio of \\<0.3 by array CGH; or from sequencing data with sufficient coverage for evaluation). Rearrangement/evidence or intragenic breaks by copy or sequencing assay also will be considered eligible for study (any copy status). OR CDK4 or CDK6 high-level amplification. (The amplicon size must be \\<10Mb and the magnitude the gain must be log2 ratio \\>1.5 or estimated as \\>10 copies). AND Validation of wild-type RB status (no deletion/losses more than single copy by copy number or sequencing data; and/or no inactivating mutations by sequencing). Participants must be at first relapse of GBM. Relapse is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation+/- chemo if that was used as initial therapy). The intent therefore is that patients had no more than 1 prior therapy (initial treatment). If the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed disease and no anti-cancer therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the patient undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered to constitute 1 relapse. Participants must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI or CT scan. For Cohort 2 subjects, CT or MRI within 14 days prior to study registration. For Cohort 2, corticosteroid dose must be stable or decreasing for at least 5 days prior to the scan. If steroids are added or the steroid dose is increased between the date of the screening MRI or CT scan and the start of treatment, a new baseline MRI or CT is required. For Cohort 1 subjects, CT or MRI should be performed ideally within 14 days prior to study registration, but because the screening MRI for this subset of subjects will not be used for evaluation of response, it is acceptable for this MRI/CT to have been performed greater than 14 days prior to registration if unavoidable.

Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for eligibility. To best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, an MRI or CT scan should ideally have been performed no later than 96 hours following surgery, or at least 28 days post-operatively, but scans performed outside of this window are considered acceptable if no alternative is available.
